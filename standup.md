# StandUp Notes
## What did I work on before?
Finishing the finance data for the company, factoring food costs, rental space, equipment depreciation, and notes payable (loans).
## What am I working on today?
Breaking the news to my laborers in a calm, collected way that everyone will be out of a job due to lack of funds.
## What issues are blocking me?
The temperment and attitudes of my team, risk management of hostility, and lack of appropriate documentation of funds (evident of misappropriation or theft).
